- str.match(regex) and "g" flag:

Return value ( of match()):
An Array whose contents depend on the presence or absence of the global (g) flag, or null if no matches are found

If the g flag is used, all results matching the complete regular expression will be returned, 
but capturing groups will not.
if the g flag is not used, only the first complete match and its related capturing groups are returned.
 In this case, the returned item will have additional properties as described below.
